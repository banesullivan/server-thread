Launch a WSGIApplication in a background thread with werkzeug.

This application was created for [`localtileserver`](https://github.com/banesullivan/localtileserver)
and provides the basis for how it can launch an image tile server as a
background thread for visualizing data in Jupyter notebooks.

While this may not be a widely applicable library, it is useful for a few
Python packages I have created that require a background service.


## üöÄ Usage

Use the `ServerThread` with any WSGIApplication.

Start by creating a WSGIApplication (this can be a flask app or a simple app
like below):


```py
# Create some WSGI Application
from werkzeug import Request, Response

@Request.application
def app(request):
    return Response("howdy", 200)
```

Then launch the app with the `ServerThread` class:


```py
import requests
from server_thread import ServerThread

# Launch app in a background thread
server = ServerThread(app)

# Perform requests against the server without blocking
requests.get(f"http://{server.host}:{server.port}/").raise_for_status()
```


## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation

Get started with `server-thread` to create applications that require a
WSGIApplication in the background.

### üêç Installing with `conda`

Conda makes managing `server-thread`'s dependencies across platforms quite
easy and this is the recommended method to install:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge server-thread
```

### üé° Installing with `pip`

If you prefer pip, then you can install from PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/server-thread/

```
pip install server-thread
```
